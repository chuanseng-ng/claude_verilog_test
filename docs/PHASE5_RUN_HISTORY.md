# Phase 5 SoC — ASAP7 P&R Run History (M11)

Full-SoC ASAP7 hierarchical place-and-route campaign (M11). Mirrors
`docs/ASAP7_RUN_HISTORY.md` (CPU/GPU). The SoC integrates the CPU + GPU as hard
macros with the crossbar / AXI-Lite interconnect / DMA / peripherals / PLL stub
synthesized flat. Branch `feature/phase7-mixed-signal-pll`.

## Sign-off result (run 14 — accepted)

Run `RUN_2026-06-23_18-05-38`, sv2v synthesis frontend, single-clock 1750 ps.

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Fmax** | **571 MHz** (1750 ps period; setup WS **+113.6 ps**, achievable ~611 MHz) |
| Hold | WS **+22.2 ps** (WNS 0) |
| **Power** | **62.9 mW** (internal 47.6 / switching 15.3 / leakage 0.03 mW) |
| **Die** | 520 × 520 µm (270,400 µm²); core 249,716 µm² |
| Std-cell area | 31,322 µm²; **245,149 std-cells**; **65.6 % utilization** |
| Macros | 2 (rv32i_cpu_top, gpu_top — hard macros) |
| Routing DRC | **0** (`design__violations = 0`) |
| Antenna | **0** violating nets/pins |
| Max slew / cap / fanout | 0 |
| PDN power-grid violations | 8,281,711 — **benign PSM-0039 tap-cell tool artifact** (see note) |

SoC fmax is GPU-governed (GPU macro signed off at 571 MHz); the flattened
integration logic + CPU macro meet the same period with positive margin.

### PDN note (why the tap-cell violations are accepted)
The 8.28 M power-grid violations are all `PSM-0039 Unconnected instance
TAP_TAPCELL_ROW_*/VDD|VSS` — a documented ASAP7 tool artifact (tap-cell wells tie
through the substrate, not the routed grid). The standalone CPU/GPU ASAP7
sign-offs carried ~1.8 M of the identical artifact and were accepted. Real
std-cell + macro power connectivity is intact (timing/power are valid). This is an
**indicative ASAP7** sign-off (predictive PDK — no Magic/KLayout DRC or Netgen LVS,
as with the CPU/GPU sign-offs).

## Run campaign

| Run | Outcome | Key event |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| 1–12 | hollow | `SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE=keep` + Synlig left peripheral submodules unflattened → **0 DFFs at soc_top** → STA saw no paths (ws=1e42), 20 µW, 0.57 % util. Every "Flow complete" was empty. PDN macro-connection + SDC clock bugs surfaced and were fixed but masked by the deeper synth problem. |
| 13 | first **valid** | **sv2v frontend** (see below) → 43,546 DFFs, real placement+route. First real numbers: setup **−364 ps** (fails), clock skew **214 ps** (abnormal), PDN tap artifact, hold clean. |
| 14 | **sign-off** | Dropped the broken `create_generated_clock` → single clean `clk_i` H-tree; IO delays 350/20→175/10 ps; CTS tuning. **Setup +113.6 ps (MET @ 571 MHz)**, hold +22.2 ps, 0 DRC, 0 antenna, 62.9 mW, 65.6 % util. |
| 15 | reverted | Added M7 PG geometry to macro LEFs to chase the PDN count — **no effect** (8.28 M identical: the violations are the tap artifact, not macro pins) **and** setup regressed to −341 ps (M7 PG shapes over macros likely blocked routing). Change reverted (`f84813c`). |

## The synthesis blocker and fix (the central M11 problem)

LibreLane's **Synlig/UHDM SystemVerilog frontend cannot synthesize this SoC**:
- `SYNLIG_DEFER=true` — silently drops peripheral FSM logic (0 DFFs → hollow P&R).
- `SYNLIG_DEFER=false` — crashes Yosys `rtlil.cc:2150` (empty wire name in UHDM `-link`).
- `USE_SYNLIG=false` — native `read_verilog -sv` fails on `package…endpackage`.

**Fix:** `sv2v 0.0.13.1` (nixpkgs `haskellPackages.sv2v`) converts all SoC
SystemVerilog → flat Verilog-2005, then native Yosys `read_verilog` + `flatten` +
blackbox the two macros → 43,546 DFFs, 110 k cells, clean. The verified RTL
(`soc_all` 82/82) remains the correctness source; sv2v is a synth-frontend
transform only (Verilator lint skipped on its benign `1'sb0`/ascending-range
output). **Always sanity-check DFF count > 0 after SoC synth.** Core commit
`6ee91b6`.

Also fixed en route: SoC-level SDC (single `clk_i` clock + clean H-tree),
`PDN_MACRO_CONNECTIONS` (removed the behavioral `sram_controller`, which is flat
std-cells, not a macro), die shrink (720→520 µm), and the librelane tool patches
(`pyosys.py` json_header, `synthesize.py` hierarchy `-check`) needed for the flow.

## Reproduce

```bash
cd pnr && make librelane-asap7-soc      # sv2v frontend; run dir on /nobackup
# metrics: <run>/final/metrics.json
```

## Known limitations / follow-ups
- **sv2v ≠ formal-equivalent to source RTL.** Correctness rests on `soc_all` 82/82
  against the original SystemVerilog. A Yosys EQY/LEC of sv2v output vs RTL would
  add tape-out rigor (not required for indicative ASAP7).
- **CPU macro LEF lacks AXI4 burst ports** (`awlen`/`wlast`/…) — abstract predates
  the M2 burst upgrade; SoC burst nets dangle at the macro boundary. Indicative-PPA
  acceptable; regenerate the abstract for a clean integration (bead
  `claude_verilog_test-g0o`).
- Timing showed run-to-run variance (run 14 +113 ps vs run 15 −341 ps with the LEF
  change); the +113 ps margin is an indicative single-run result.
