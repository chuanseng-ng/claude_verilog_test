**Archive Policy**: Documents are archived when:
1. Setup/installation processes are complete and stable
2. Session summaries have been consolidated into permanent documentation
3. Information is redundant with maintained docs (README, CLAUDE.md, TODO)
4. Historical record is needed but active reference is not

Documents are **never deleted**, only archived for historical reference.
